# BusMall

A Code Fellows 201 project requiring click-tracking.

The user will view three randomly chosen items from a catalogue and select one of the three as their favorite item. There will 
never be duplicates shown together, nor will an item be shown in consecutive iterations. After 25 votes have been cast, the results
will be tallied and posted to a scrollable window, above, and a bar graph, below. 

This application utilizes data persistence and pushes the results to local storage, so numerous voting sessions will be tallied.
